          <p>Once upon a time there was a shoe shop called the <i>Designers</i>. The shop’s owner is Lucas but the town did not know Lucas was an elf. Lucas made the shoes out of magic no wonder they were so perfect. But one day his magic disappeared and all the shoes were gone because his shoes were made out of magic. The shoes cannot be solid without his magic. So they collapsed into particles and the <i>Designers</i> had to close. Lucas went away to the land of magic for answers. He had to find a doctor. He didn’t have to walk long because the doctor’s office was a few meters away and the doctors knew every single magic illness.  But when he got there, the office was empty and there was nothing except a desk. A fairy came out of nowhere and asked him what illness he had and he told him everything. When Lucas had finished talking, the doctor said there’s only one cure and he had to drink camel’s blood. So he had to go to the desert. While he was going, there was a river in the way. He went to find a log so he could cross the river. Then he found a long log and crossed the river.  He was in the desert trying to find a camel and he found a dead camel who had bled. He took  the camel’s blood and drank it. He got back his magic. He teleported himself back home. The  shoes came back, the <i>Designers</i> was opened again and he lived happily ever after.</p>
