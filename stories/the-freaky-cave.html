        <p>
            Once upon a time there was a village called Yamuur. The people in the village were very afraid of the cave in the woods because John, a clockmaker never came back from the cave. So no one ever entered the cave, but one day Johnâ€™s son Jake was chopping trees when he found a rusty lamp so he rubbed it a genie appeared and said you have three wishes, then he asked to be safe while entering the cave in the woods. Then Jake ran to the cave, he went in and saw his father trapped and his father said he had to go over the wall and get back with the key and open the cage. He rubbed the lamp and the genie to have jumping powers for two minutes. He leaped over and came back with the key and told the to set them free and they lived happily ever after.
